# project_final

For the Final Project I have made a website dedicated to people who are looking to learn about fitness and can talk to each other, upload photos and have a general
discussion based on their workouts. This website will allow for the creation of profiles, the ability to make posts and add photos, connect to Social Media, watch videos,
and have their own unique profiles under a dashboard. On the back end, if a user forgets their password, they will be able to reset it using sendgrid. The photos and other
media are stored in Cloudinary, while the database model utilizes PostgrsSQL within the Heroku VPS. The Social media Authentication feature runs through a middleware and 
allows users with github and facebook accounts to log in with those credentials.
